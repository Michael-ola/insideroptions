    question: "How do I verify my account, and what documents are needed?",
    answer: `To verify your account, youâ€™ll need to make a deposit first and provide a color photo of your valid primary identity document (passport or national ID card) containing a clear photo, full name, date and place of birth, expiration date, and country of issue.

For card deposits we might additionally ask you to provide your card statement in order to have your credit/debit card verified.

Please ensure the provided documents are clear and easy to read.`,

Please do not use 3rd party wallets or cards to deposit, in cases where 3rd-party payment accounts are used for the deposit, we may not have the option for a refund, and an additional verification process may be neccessary.",
